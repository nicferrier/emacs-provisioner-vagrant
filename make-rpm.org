* general advice on building RPMs
** http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Mandriva_RPM_HOWTO#Building_an_RPM_package

* from the github repo
** clone the repo
** make the tarball
make-dist --tar
** upload the tarball somewhere (github?)

* from the tarball
** cp the tarball to an rpmdev environment
*** like https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-provisioner-vagrant
**** the puppet setup there builds it
*** I'll probably alter that repo to make it an rpm provisioner
** then build the rpm
*** vagrant ssh
*** then 
rm -rf ~/rpmbuild
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
echo '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > ~/.rpmmacros
cp /vagrant/emacs-centos-6.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
cp /vagrant/emacs-24* ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
rpmbuild -ba emacs-centos-6.spec
cp ../RPMS/i386/emacs-24.1.50-1.i386.rpm /vagrant/
*** makes emacs-24.1.50-1.i386.rpm
